			This project explores the timeline of typographic evolution from the 1800s through the late 1900s, using text excerpts from Ellen Lupton's <em>Thinking With Type</em>. It features a typographic timeline composed of the typefaces cited within the selected chapters. The selections from Lupton are stylistically contrasted with my personal perspective.

			This project, a collaboration with Kinza Ghanchi, immerses the reader in the potential user experience challenge they may face as an elder. Using text from Don Norman's article, <em>I wrote the book on user-friendly design. What I see today horrifies me.</em>, we explore the notion that senior-centric design can optimize user experiences for all.

			Revisiting <em>Thinking With Type</em> by Ellen Lupton, this project aggregates multiple articles focused on the transition of type from the page to the screen. With addition text excerpts from <em>My Typographies</em> by Paul Elliman and <em>Typeface as Programme</em> by Jürg Lehni, I created a design system to connect the pieces with aesthetics that allude to the grittiness of the hot metal typesetting process.
